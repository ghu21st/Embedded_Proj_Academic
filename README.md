This is a project repository that include two select Academic projects I did that highlight my hands-on experience and skills on: 



1\) Project1: "Cellphone\_wireless\_sensor\_with\_MCU", A real-time wireless communication sensor embedded system via cell phone development - using Microchip 16-bit MCU (C/C++) for real-time audio data transmission over cellular network; It includes hardware and software design and development using A/D, D/A, FSM, and multitasking. 



2\) Project2: "Smart\_Mouse\_with\_ANN", A Windows application that can be trained (or re-trained) to recognize the user mouse input moving pattern (square, circle, triangle, ...etc) and then open related Windows desktop application (customizable for any Windows application, such as Explorer, Paint, Word) in less than a second. It is much faster than user following windows menu to open the related Windows application. 



All above projects were developed and completed by myself and built from scratch, and all presented and demoed successfully to project stakeholders/supervisors/professors when I studied in Concordia for MEng (Master in Engineering).
